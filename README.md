# USTEP: Tracking and Improving Patient Recovery

USTEP is an innovative app developed in collaboration with the University of Utah Hospital to help patients recovering from Arterial PVD surgery monitor their health and recovery process without the need to travel for check-ups. 


## Scenario Overview

Doctors require regular check-ins post-surgery to ensure patient recovery, but in-person visits can be challenging for those living far away. USTEP offers a solution by enabling patients to report their progress remotely through an intuitive app interface.

## Features

- **Patient-Friendly Interface**: Simple onboarding process with health data permissions setup.
- **Custom Questionnaires**: Patients can complete PROMs surveys tailored to their specific conditions, like arterial or venous disease.
- **Activity Tracking**: Integrates with devices to track steps and physical activity.
- **Health Trends Analysis**: Visual representation of recovery trends and questionnaire score history.

## Onboarding

Patients sign up for an account, accept a consent form, and input their health details to personalize the app experience.

## Interaction

- **Visual Tasks**: Patients can upload images for visual-based health tasks.
- **Timed Physical Tests**: The app facilitates physical tests with integrated timing mechanisms.
- **Survey Completion**: Easy-to-navigate surveys are filled out directly in the app.
